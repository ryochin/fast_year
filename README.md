[fast_year](https://rubygems.org/gems/fast_year) is a Ruby's simple C extension which provides a faster implementation of getting the current year.

The function call is almost **2x faster** compared to ordinary `Time.now.year()`.


## Usage

`FastYear.year()` returns the current local 4 digit year.

```ruby
irb> require 'fast_year'
irb> FastYear.year    # -> 2022
```

And is intended for placing as HTML footer signature like:

```erb
<p>&copy; <%= FastYear.year %> - Acme Inc.</p>
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fast_year'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle install
```
